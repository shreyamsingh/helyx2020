                <p>
                    Arguably the most dangerous impact we have on dry land as a species is our discarded plastic or otherwise non-biodegradable refuse that 
                    often ends up in our natural habitats, mostly near urban centers or highways. These wastes often contain harmful chemicals that can seep
                    into the soil and in turn into the groundwater, harming all organisms that rely on that water, whether directly or indirectly. This 
                    project's goal is to provide an incentive for people who come across this waste to either mark it for pickup, earning whoever rises 
                    to the challenge points, or to pick it up themselves, earning points in the process. A leaderboard is provided to offer further incentive 
                    and friendly competition in the spirit of cleanup throughout the world.
